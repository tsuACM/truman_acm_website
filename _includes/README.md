# _includes
This folder stores the site's HTML header, footer, and navigation. The header contains basic HTML info that doesn't need to be edited. 
The footer lists our social medias, so edit this as well as the about page if that information needs to be updated. You can also 
edit navigation.html to change the nav bar at the top of each page should a new page be necessary.
