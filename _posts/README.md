# _posts 
These contain meeting minutes from 2018 and 2019. General meeting minutes are no longer recorded or displayed on the site, so this folder currently goes unused. 

## Meeting Minutes
Should ACM ever start keeping minutes again, follow these steps to add new minutes: 

- Open the file `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` in the main acm folder 
- Save the file under a new name, which should be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-string.md` 
- Fill out the file's contents. The title tag will be what is actually displayed on the webpage, so it should be meaningful 
- Place the new file in `_posts` 

The new page should be added the next time you build the site.
