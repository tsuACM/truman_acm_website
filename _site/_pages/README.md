# _pages
This folder contains the actual content for the website's pages. Generally, you will need to edit `events.markdown` and `about.markdown` most frequently. The only site page not in this folder is the home page, which can be found in the main acm folder as `index.markdown`. 

`meetings.md` was used to display a list of meeting minutes, which ACM no longer keeps. 

`gamejam.md`, `hacktruman.md`, and `orderform.md` are used for game jams, codeathons, and T-shirt orders, respectively. If similar events are done again in the future, these pages can be added back to the site by re-enabling their navigation links in `navigation.html` in `_includes`. See the README in that folder for more information.
