# _pages
This folder contains the actual content for the website's pages. Generally, you will need to edit `events.markdown` and `about.markdown` most 
frequently - the other pages are currently unused. The only site page not in this folder is the home page, which can be found in the main acm 
folder as `index.markdown`. These three pages should be the only ones you need to edit. `meetings.md` was used to display a list of meeting 
minutes, which ACM no longer keeps. The other pages were used for various past CS events, and if similar events are done again in the future, 
these pages can be added back to the site by re-enabling their navigation links in `navigation.html` in `_includes`.
