# _site 
Whenever you use 
```
jekyll build
```
to rebuild the site, the compiled HTML and CSS are stored in this folder. Each page has its own folder containing the associated HTML file. 

**Do not edit the contents of this folder**, as any changes made in here will be overwritten when you build the site. If you want to view the pages to review your changes, open each HTML file in your browser. Keep in mind, however, that the various links used in the HTML pages are relative to how they are set up on Truman's sand server, and will therefore not work properly on your local machine. This includes styling, so pages will likely appear as plain HTML. When you pull onto the sand server, the links will work and the site will appear as normal.
