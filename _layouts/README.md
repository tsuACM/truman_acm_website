# _layouts
These HTML documents describe how different types of pages should be put together. They generally do not need to be edited. 
default.html is the base page layout that assembles the head, footer, and navigation from _includes. page.html adds the header 
with the page's title and provides a space for content. post.html is currently unused, as it was originally for meeting minutes.
