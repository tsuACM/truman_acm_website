# _layouts
These HTML documents describe how different types of pages should be put together. `default.html` is the base page layout that assembles the head, footer, and navigation from `_includes`. `page.html` adds the header with the page's title and provides a space for content. 
`post.html` is currently unused, as it was originally for meeting minutes. These pages generally can be left alone - edit the files in `_includes` instead if page layouts need to be changed.
