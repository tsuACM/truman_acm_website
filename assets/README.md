# assets 
Contains files that appear on the website. Most folders contain images, and `python_con` contains python files which are currently unused. 

To display an image on the website, use: 

```
![image name]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/[full path to image])
```

The image name can be anything. 

For example, to display an image in the `hackathon` folder called `CodeathonPosterFull.png`, you could use

```
![Codeathon Poster]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/hackathon/CodeathonPosterFull.png)
```
