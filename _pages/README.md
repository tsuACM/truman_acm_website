# _pages
This folder contains the actual content for the website's pages. Generally, you will need to edit events.markdown and about.markdown most 
frequently - the other pages are currently unused. The only site page not in this folder is the home page, which can be found in the main acm 
folder as index.markdown. These three pages should be the only ones you need to edit. meetings.md is unnecessary because both meetings
and events are found on events.markdown.
