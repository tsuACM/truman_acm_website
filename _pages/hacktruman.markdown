More information will be available closer to the judging date, so keep checking back! 


## Theme: Return

The theme of the Codeathon is Return! Teams are required to incorporate this theme into their project in some way, but they may interpret it however they choose. 


## Prizes

There will be 3 awards given to 3 different projects. The awards are: 

* Most Technical - For the project which demonstrates the most technical skill.
